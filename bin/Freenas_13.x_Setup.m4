***Setup Structure***
```
__POOL__ > __MEDIA_DATASET__ >  -__SONARR_COMPLETED__
                 -__RADARR_COMPLETED__
                 -__LIDARR_COMPLETED__
                 -downloads > -__SONARR_DOWNLOADS__
                              -__RADARR_DOWNLOADS__
                              -__LIDARR_DOWNLOADS__
                              -complete
                              -incomplete
                              -__SABNZBD_FILES__
                            ```

You have pool named "__POOL__". And created a dataset named "__MEDIA_DATASET__" owned by the default freenas user __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__. The dataset contains the folders: __SONARR_COMPLETED__, __RADARR_COMPLETED__, __LIDARR_COMPLETED__ and downloads. You also have a dataset named "__APPS_DATASET__" to hold the jails config data.
```

***ISSUES RESOLVED IN INSTALL SCRIPTS:***

Permissions
------  
For Sonarr, Radarr, Lidarr, Bazarr and Transmission/Deluge to share files, the default user is changed to to __MEDIA_USER__:__MEDIA_GROUP__ so the jails can work together properly.

MONO 5.20 compatibility
------
Sonarr and Lidarr have moved away from mono 5.10.  For these two, PORTS are installed to apply a patch to v5.20.1.34 and installed. Installation of these two jails takes a LONG time due to Ports installation and compiling Mono from source.

OPENVPN
------
A VPN may not be desired by everyone. Execute "torrent_add_VPN.sh" to process the necessary additions for __TORRENT_JAIL__.
